# html-challenge

In this challenge, we are exploring web-scraping; specifically with data from the Mars Rover Curiosity.

All codes are my own, I did utilize AskBCs when I was stuck in certain areas. For Part 2 of the assignment, I used pandas to parse the data from the html for 2 reasons:

1.) The code is simpler and looks more elegant.
2.) Under grading in canvas for part 2, it says "The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types. (15 points)".
